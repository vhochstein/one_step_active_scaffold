A really basic script to create a new rails 3 application using active_scaffold and a player and team model.
Afterwards you can just say rails s to start your application.

Please note that you need git up and running in your shell.
In addition your database setup needs to be up and running.

ruby one_step_activescaffold.rb -h

Usage: one_step_activescaffold [app_name] [js_lib] [database] [db_user] [db_password]
app_name   : name of your rails application ; default: howto
js_lib     : valid Values: ["prototype", "jquery"]; default: prototype
database   : valid values: ["sqlite3", "mysql", "postgresl", "oracle", "frontbase", "ibm_db"]; default: sqlite3
db_user    : username for your db; default: <db_specific>
db_password: pasword for your db user; default: ''

If you do not want to create a player and a team model, you can specify your own models in a 'model_setup.rb' file, which needs to be in the same directory as 'one_step_activescaffold.rb'.


Examples:
ruby one_step_activescaffold.rb

ruby one_step_activescaffold.rb my_new_app jquery mysql

ruby one_step_activescaffold.rb my_new_app jquery postgres john top_secret

model_setup.rb:
puts %x[rails g active_scaffold coach name:string]
